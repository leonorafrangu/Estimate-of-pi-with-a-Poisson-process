# Estimate-of-pi-with-a-Poisson-process
We want to find an expression to evaluate in our simulation to approximate π. We know that by dividing the area of the circle by the area of its bounding square we get π4. We can estimate π by taking the ratio of simulated points that fall within the circle and the total number of simulated points(using a Poisson Process) and then multiplying by 4.
